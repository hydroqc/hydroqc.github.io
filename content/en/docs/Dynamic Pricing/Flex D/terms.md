## Period

In the context of winter credits, a period is a time slot during which a specific rate or algorithmic logic is applied by Hydro-Québec.

There are 2 types of periods:

### Peak

A peak period is a period during which energy consumption of all customers is generally high.
In the context of Flex D, the following time slots are peak periods:

Morning peak period: 06:00 to 10:00
Evening peak period: 16:00 to 20:00

### Normal

Any period that is not a peak period.
